# TESTS

### TESTS is a project that gives a user multiple quizzes to choose from like EQ test, Personality Test, Mental Age Test, and even some Math Riddles.
 
### While taking the Mental age and EQ test, the program calculates the score and displays the result. The personality Test reveals the significance of the answers given by the user after all the questions are answered. The Math Riddles are simple yet tricky that not everyone can answer.

The front end is designed in PyCharm. The project provides results that are quite reliable as are adopted and modified from reliable sources.
